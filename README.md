## Dataset Content
* Synthetic data set created by Laksika Tharmalingam for illustrative purposes. The Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset comprises 400 rows and 13 columns, covering a wide range of variables related to sleep and daily habits. It includes details such as gender, age, occupation, sleep duration, quality of sleep, physical activity level, stress levels, BMI category, blood pressure, heart rate, daily steps, and the presence or absence of sleep disorders. It has been stored on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset/data).

* Dataset Columns:
Person ID: An identifier for each individual.

Gender: The gender of the person (Male/Female).

Age: The age of the person in years.

Occupation: The occupation or profession of the person.

Sleep Duration (hours): The number of hours the person sleeps per day.

Quality of Sleep (scale: 1-10): A subjective rating of the quality of sleep, ranging from 1 to 10.

Physical Activity Level (minutes/day): The number of minutes the person engages in physical activity daily.

Stress Level (scale: 1-10): A subjective rating of the stress level experienced by the person, ranging from 1 to 10.

BMI Category: The BMI category of the person (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight).

Blood Pressure (systolic/diastolic): The blood pressure measurement of the person, indicated as systolic pressure over diastolic pressure.

Heart Rate (bpm): The resting heart rate of the person in beats per minute.

Daily Steps: The number of steps the person takes per day.

Sleep Disorder: The presence or absence of a sleep disorder in the person (None, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea).

* Details about Sleep Disorder Column:

None: The individual does not exhibit any specific sleep disorder.

Insomnia: The individual experiences difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, leading to inadequate or poor-quality sleep.

Sleep Apnea: The individual suffers from pauses in breathing during sleep, resulting in disrupted sleep patterns and potential health risks.

## Business Requirements
* Objective:
To analyze the impact of physical activity, stress, BMI, daily steps, and sleep disorders on sleep quality using data-driven insights. The goal is to validate key hypotheses and provide actionable recommendations for improving sleep health.

Key Questions to Address:
How does physical activity influence sleep quality?
What is the correlation between stress levels and sleep duration?
How does BMI category affect sleep quality?
Do daily steps impact sleep duration and quality?
Are individuals with sleep disorders more likely to experience high heart rates and blood pressure?


## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* Higher physical activity levels are associated with better sleep quality.
* Increased stress levels correlate with lower sleep quality and shorter sleep duration.
* Individuals classified as obese have lower sleep quality compared to those with normal BMI.
* More daily steps correlate with better sleep duration and quality.
* People with sleep disorders (e.g., Sleep Apnea) have higher blood pressure and heart rates.


## Project Plan
* Outline the high-level steps taken for the analysis.
* How was the data managed throughout the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation steps?
* Why did you choose the research methodologies you used?

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations

## Analysis techniques used
* List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
* How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
* Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
* How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations
* Were there any data privacy, bias or fairness issues with the data?
* How did you overcome any legal or societal issues?

## Dashboard Design
* List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other item that your dashboard library supports.
* Later, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but subsequently you used another plot type).
* How were data insights communicated to technical and non-technical audiences?
* Explain how the dashboard was designed to communicate complex data insights to different audiences. 

## Unfixed Bugs
* Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
* Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
* If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.

## Development Roadmap
* What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
* What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience? 

## Deployment
### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/ 
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. From the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file.


## Main Data Analysis Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
